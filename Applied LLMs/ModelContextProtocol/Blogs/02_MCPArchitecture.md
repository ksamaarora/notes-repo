# ðŸ§© Three Components of MCP Architecture

**MCP** operates through **three essential components** that work together seamlessly.

## **1. MCP Host Application**

The **Host Application** represents the **software that people actually use and interact with**. This could be **Claude Desktop**, where users chat with an AI assistant, **ChatGPT** running in a web browser, or a **custom application** built by a company for specific tasks.

The **host application** serves as the **orchestrator** of the entire interaction. It manages the **user interface**, receives **user requests**, determines what **external data or tools** are needed, and presents **responses** back to the user in a meaningful way.

Different hosts serve different purposes. **Claude Desktop** focuses on general-purpose AI assistance for individual users. **Development environments** like Cursor or **GitHub Copilot** help programmers write code more efficiently. **Enterprise applications** might be designed for specific workflows like **customer service** or **data analysis**.

## **2. MCP Client**

The **MCP Client** acts as the **translator** that lives inside each host application.

When the host needs to connect to an external data source, it creates an **MCP client** specifically for that connection. Each client maintains a **dedicated one-to-one relationship** with a single MCP server.

If a host application needs to access multiple data sources, it creates **multiple clients**, one for each server it needs to communicate with. The client handles all the **technical details of the MCP protocol**, converting **requests** from the host into properly formatted **MCP messages** and translating **responses** back into a format the host can use.

## **3. MCP Server**

The **MCP Server** forms the **bridge** between the **MCP protocol** and actual **data sources**.

Each server typically focuses on one specific integration, wrapping around a particular **service or system** to expose its **capabilities** through MCP. For example, a **PostgreSQL MCP server** knows how to connect to PostgreSQL databases and translate MCP requests into SQL queries. Similarly, a **GitHub MCP server** understands how to interact with GitHubâ€™s API to fetch repository information or create issues.

These servers can run **locally** on the same machine as the host application â€” useful for accessing **local files or databases**. They can also run **remotely** on **cloud infrastructure**, enabling connections to **web services and APIs**.
