Why Anthropic’s MCP is a Big Deal

Imagine asking an AI system about tomorrow’s meetings, only to receive a polite response that it cannot access calendar information. Or requesting current stock prices and getting data from months ago.

This disconnect between AI capabilities and real-world data represents one of the most significant limitations in artificial intelligence today.

The root of this problem lies in how AI models work. Large language models like GPT-4 or Claude are trained on vast amounts of text data, but this training happens at a specific point in time. Once training completes, the model’s knowledge becomes frozen. It cannot learn about events that happened after its training date, cannot access private company data, and cannot interact with external systems or databases. 

Traditionally, connecting AI to external data sources meant writing custom integration code for each system. A developer would need separate code to connect their AI to Google Drive, different code for Slack, another implementation for their database, and so on.

This approach quickly becomes unsustainable. As more AI applications emerge and more data sources need integration, the complexity multiplies exponentially.

MCP provides a standardized way for AI systems to connect with any data source or tool. Major technology companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, have already adopted this protocol, signaling its emergence as a universal standard for AI connectivity.
