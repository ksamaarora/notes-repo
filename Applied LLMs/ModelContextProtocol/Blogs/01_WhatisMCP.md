What is MCP ? 

Before MCP, the AI industry faced a multiplication problem. For example, if we had 10 AI applications that each needed to connect to 20 different data sources, we would need to write 200 separate integration programs (10 multiplied by 20). Each combination required its own custom code. 

MCP transforms this multiplication into simple addition. Now those same 10 AI applications and 20 data sources only need 30 implementations total: each AI application implements MCP once, and each data source implements MCP once. They can all then communicate freely with each other.
