## 🧩 **Part 1 — What is Generative AI?**

**Generative AI (Gen AI)** is a branch of artificial intelligence that can **create new content** — text, images, music, or code — by **learning patterns from existing data** and mimicking aspects of human creativity.
Instead of just analyzing or classifying information, generative models *produce* new, original outputs.

## ⚙️ **LangChain — The Framework Behind Applied LLMs**

**LangChain** is an **open-source framework** designed to simplify the process of building **LLM-based applications**.
It provides modular components and end-to-end tools that help developers rapidly create complex AI systems such as:

* Chatbots
* Question-answering systems
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
* Autonomous agents
* Domain-specific assistants

---

## 💡 **Why LangChain Became Popular**

1. **Wide LLM Support** – Works with all major models: OpenAI, Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.
2. **Simplified Development** – Offers pre-built abstractions for prompts, chains, memory, and agents.
3. **Seamless Integrations** – Includes ready-made wrappers for APIs, databases, vector stores, and cloud tools.
4. **Open Source & Actively Developed** – Free, community-driven, and continuously updated.
5. **Covers All Gen AI Use-Cases** – From RAG and summarization to reasoning agents and workflow orchestration.
