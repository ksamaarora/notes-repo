Part 6 Git Remove File 

Now continuing,
If you want to add multiple files git add . command 

then git commmit -m "your message"

Say you want to remove a file 
just delete it from vs code, but is your job really done?

No it is deleted from your working directory 

delete from git 
git rm --cached yourfilename.txt
and now if u delete from vs code, it would be actually deleted from git
