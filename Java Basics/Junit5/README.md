Junit 

Testing vs Unit Testing 
Junit is a framework used for writing and running tests in Java. It is primarily used for unit testing, which involves testing individual components or units of code to ensure they work as expected.

Unit Testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. The goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.

Testing comes under the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) and is a broader term that encompasses various types of testing, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and more. Testing can be performed at different levels of the software development process to ensure the overall quality and functionality of the application.

Units in simple terms can be understood as the smallest testable parts of an application, such as functions, methods, or classes. Unit testing focuses on verifying the correctness of these individual units in isolation.

Junit 5 Architecture:
Junit 5 is composed of three main modules:
Jupiter: This module provides the new programming model and extension model for writing tests and extensions in Junit 5. It includes annotations, assertions, and other features for creating and executing tests.
Vintage: This module provides support for running Junit 3 and Junit 4 tests on the Junit 5 platform. It allows for backward compatibility with older versions of Junit.
Platform: This module serves as the foundation for launching testing frameworks on the Junit 5 platform. It provides the necessary infrastructure for discovering and executing tests.
